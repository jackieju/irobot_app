GO
BACKWARD
RAISE YOUR HANDS
SAY HELLO
CHASING BOLL
TRACK MY FACE
TURN AROUND
LOOK AT ME
SAY SOMETHING
PLAY WITH YOURSELF
CLEAN MY DESK
STOP	
WALL E SHARE ME SOME LIGHT
WALL E TURN OFF LIGHT
WALL E WHAT'S THE MOVIE
WALL E HOW IS THE WHETHER
WALL E GIVE ME SOME WIND
WALL E MUSIC
WALL E DANCE
WALL E TAKE PHOTO
WALL E SING A SONG
